## To Run

Clone the repo, and run ```npm i``` then ```npm start``` in the ```src/``` directory. Only runs on Windows.

## About

Your life needs more rich presence! Run this Node app in the background to update Discord with your currently running app and window title.

Want support for macOS/Linux? Feel free to make a pull request over at [Adybo123/node-process-windows](https://github.com/Adybo123/node-process-windows) , as this repo doesn't actually contain the code for getting window titles.

Inspired by [jczstudios/discord-chrome-presence](https://github.com/jczstudios/discord-chrome-presence) , and relys on my modified version of [bryphe/node-process-windows](https://github.com/bryphe/node-process-windows)
