## To Run

Clone the repo, and run ```npm i``` then ```npm start``` in the ```src/``` directory. Runs on Windows and macOS.

## About

Your life needs more rich presence! Run this Node app in the background to update Discord with your currently running app and window title.

Want support for Linux? Feel free to make a pull request over at [Adybo123/node-process-windows](https://github.com/Adybo123/node-process-windows) , as this repo doesn't actually contain the code for getting window titles.

Inspired by [jczstudios/discord-chrome-presence](https://github.com/jczstudios/discord-chrome-presence) , and relys on my modified version of [bryphe/node-process-windows](https://github.com/bryphe/node-process-windows)
